# 🧩 Figma Export Organizer — Built to Fix What Figma Missed

> A small idea turned into a time-saver for every designer who’s tired of messy exports.

---

## 🪄 The Backstory

As a designer, exporting assets from Figma always felt... clunky.  
Even with all its power, Figma didn’t make it easy to **export frames cleanly** — especially when files grew large and cluttered.  

Every time I had to:
- Manually group frames by background or section  
- Rename exports so they made sense  
- Delete things I never wanted exported (like component libraries or references)  

It was repetitive, frustrating, and — honestly — a waste of creative time.  

So I decided to fix it.

## 🤖 Built with AI Assistance

I used AI tools to help me brainstorm, structure, and write parts of the logic for this plugin.  
What started as a simple automation idea became a plugin that **finally respects how designers organize their files** — not how Figma assumes we do.  

This plugin doesn’t just export — it **understands your structure**, skips the clutter, and gives you exactly what you’d expect from an intelligent export workflow.

## 🚀 What It Does

### 🎨 Export Common BG Frames  
Automatically groups & exports frames by **background color** — no clutter, no mix-ups, just clean results.  

### 🗂️ Sections Become Folders  
Your Figma **sections = folders** inside a ZIP.  
Everything is neatly structured and easy to hand off.  

### 🖼️ Multiple Formats Supported  
Export assets in **PNG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF** — pick what works best.  

### 📏 Multi-Scale Exports  
Need retina-ready images? Export at **1x, 2x, 3x, or 4x**, all at once.  

### 🚫 Exclude Sections You Don’t Need  
Skip “Components,” “References,” or any section that clutters your export.  
Focus only on what’s actually needed.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Because exporting shouldn’t break your flow.  
Figma gives you precision — but not *control* over export organization.  

This plugin fills that gap.  
It’s for every designer who wants to spend time **creating**, not **cleaning up exports**.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Select your export options (format, scale, etc.)  
2. Choose which sections to include/exclude  
3. Hit **Export All**  
4. Get a beautifully organized ZIP — grouped by section and background  

That’s it. One click, zero chaos.

## 🧠 Future Ideas

- Custom naming conventions  
- Automated compression for web  
- Export presets per project
